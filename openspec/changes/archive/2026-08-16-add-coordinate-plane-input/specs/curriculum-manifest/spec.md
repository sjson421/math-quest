## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Stage capability requirements are recorded

Each stage SHALL record the capabilities its skills require — choice input, structured math
notation, fraction keypad input, diagram rendering, expression input, number-line input,
coordinate-plane input, chart rendering, and timed mode. Recording a requirement SHALL NOT
imply it is built.

A stage's record SHALL name every capability its own skills need, not only the one it
introduces, so the set can be read off the stage rather than assembled from earlier ones.

#### Scenario: Capability requirement is queryable

- **WHEN** a stage is inspected
- **THEN** it lists the capabilities its skills depend on
- **AND** each capability is marked available or unavailable

#### Scenario: Skill needing an unavailable capability stays planned

- **WHEN** a skill requires a capability that is not yet built
- **THEN** it resolves as `planned` regardless of whether a generator exists

#### Scenario: Consumer stages record the built choice capability

- **WHEN** Stages A, C, and D are inspected
- **THEN** each lists choice input as a required capability
- **AND** choice input is marked available

#### Scenario: Consumer stages record the built number-line capability

- **WHEN** Stages C and D are inspected
- **THEN** each lists number-line input as a required capability
- **AND** number-line input is marked available

#### Scenario: Marking a capability built unlocks nothing on its own

- **WHEN** a capability becomes available and every skill needing it has no generator
- **THEN** no skill changes from `planned` to `implemented`
- **AND** the set of skills offered to the learner is unchanged

#### Scenario: Consumer stages record the built math notation capability

- **WHEN** Stages D, E, F, and G are inspected
- **THEN** each lists `math-notation` as a required capability
- **AND** `math-notation` is marked available
- **AND** none lists the rejected `katex` capability name

#### Scenario: Stage D records built fraction input without unlocking

- **WHEN** Stage D is inspected after math notation, fraction input, and diagram rendering
  become available
- **THEN** it lists `fraction-input` and `diagram` as required available capabilities
- **AND** its skills without generators remain planned
- **AND** the set of skills offered to the learner is unchanged

#### Scenario: Diagram availability is recorded without content

- **WHEN** the diagram renderer and capability flag are present before any Stage D generator
- **THEN** Stage D has no unavailable capability requirement
- **AND** no Stage D skill becomes playable until its generator is registered

#### Scenario: Stage E records built expression input without unlocking

- **WHEN** Stage E is inspected after `expression-input` becomes available
- **THEN** it lists `expression-input` as a required available capability
- **AND** its skills without generators remain planned
- **AND** the set of skills offered to the learner is unchanged

#### Scenario: Stage E records built fraction input when Unit 12 consumes it

- **WHEN** `zero-neg-exponents` requires an exact reciprocal through fraction entry
- **THEN** Stage E lists `fraction-input` as a required available capability
- **AND** no new capability implementation or availability flag is needed

#### Scenario: Stage F records complete coordinate-plane infrastructure without content

- **WHEN** coordinate-plane display and confirmed point placement are both built
- **THEN** Stage F lists `coordinate-plane` as an available required capability
- **AND** all 28 Stage F skills remain planned while none has a generator
- **AND** the playable skill total remains 145 and the offered course is unchanged
