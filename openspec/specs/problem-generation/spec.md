# Problem Generation

## Purpose

The contract every problem generator meets: what it must compute for itself, what must be
recoverable from what the learner sees, and what must stay true when the machinery behind it
is rewritten.

These rules already hold in practice but have never been written down. Stating them matters
now because 195 generators are still to be authored, and a rule enforced only by a test that
someone remembers to copy is a rule that will eventually be skipped.
## Requirements
### Requirement: A problem is fully determined by its skill, seed, and difficulty

Generating a problem from the same skill, seed, and difficulty SHALL produce an identical
problem every time, including its prose. Nothing in generation may read the clock, a global
counter, or an unseeded random source. Reproducibility is what makes a reported wrong answer
investigable — without it, a bad problem cannot be recovered from a bug report.

#### Scenario: Same seed yields the same problem

- **WHEN** a skill generates at seed 12345 and difficulty 3 twice
- **THEN** the two problems are deeply equal
- **AND** their displayed text, hint, solution steps and misconceptions all match

#### Scenario: Every generated string is seeded

- **WHEN** a generator selects among alternative wordings
- **THEN** the selection is drawn from the seeded generator passed to it
- **AND** never from an unseeded random source

### Requirement: Generators compute their own answers

A generator SHALL derive its answer from the operands it has just chosen. Answers MUST NOT be
hardcoded, looked up from a table, or obtained from any runtime service. This is the property
that makes correctness structural rather than a matter of proofreading.

#### Scenario: Answer follows from the chosen operands

- **WHEN** a generator picks operands and builds a problem
- **THEN** the stated answer is computed from those operands

### Requirement: A displayed problem carries enough to recompute its answer

Whatever a problem shows the learner SHALL be sufficient to re-derive the correct answer
independently, without consulting the answer the generator stated. A problem whose answer can
only be taken on trust is not verifiable, and a wrong answer key is the one defect this app
cannot survive.

A displayed expression MAY contain more than one operation. Recomputation SHALL read every
operand and every operator the display shows, so an expression cannot present a term the check
does not see. A structured math display whose answer is a fraction property SHALL carry the
specific fraction operation and its integer source values rather than rely on a general
notation evaluator. A structured math display of a fraction operation SHALL carry both
displayed fractions and the operator, so the result is re-derived from exact rationals over
the common denominator. A display whose answer is a mixed number SHALL carry the source
improper fraction's integer values, from which the whole part and the proper remainder
fraction are re-derived. A comparison SHALL carry both fractions and derive their relation
from exact rational values. A value-bearing choice SHALL carry its rational value as
structured data when verification must compare it with another representation.

#### Scenario: Answer is recomputed from the display, not the generator

- **WHEN** the content check examines a generated problem
- **THEN** it re-derives the answer from the displayed operands and operators alone
- **AND** fails if that value differs from the answer the generator stated

#### Scenario: Prose alone is not sufficient

- **WHEN** a problem presents its quantities as prose rather than as an expression
- **THEN** it also carries those quantities in machine-readable form
- **AND** the recomputation uses those rather than parsing the prose

#### Scenario: Every operation in a displayed expression is read

- **WHEN** a problem displays an expression containing more than one operator
- **THEN** recomputation reads every operand and operator shown
- **AND** fails and names the problem if the display cannot be read as an expression

#### Scenario: A fraction property is derived without evaluating arbitrary notation

- **WHEN** a math display asks the learner to read, name, place, complete, simplify, or compare
  a fraction
- **THEN** it carries the operation and integer values needed to derive that answer
- **AND** verification fails if the visible notation disagrees with the carried values

#### Scenario: A fraction operation is recomputed from both displayed fractions

- **WHEN** a math display asks the learner to add or subtract two fractions
- **THEN** it carries both fractions and the operator
- **AND** verification recomputes the result over the common denominator and fails if it
  differs from the stated answer

#### Scenario: A mixed-number answer is re-derived from its carried parts

- **WHEN** a math display asks the learner to convert an improper fraction to a mixed number
- **THEN** verification derives the whole part and the remainder fraction from the carried
  source values
- **AND** fails if the displayed fraction disagrees with those values or the stated answer
  differs from the derivation

#### Scenario: A diagram selects an equivalent value-bearing choice

- **WHEN** a diagram problem asks which prose choice represents the same rational amount
- **THEN** verification compares the diagram's part counts with structured choice values
- **AND** it neither parses the prose labels nor trusts the stated choice id

### Requirement: Difficulty scales the problem measurably

Raising a skill's difficulty SHALL make its problems harder in a way that can be checked, not
merely declared. Difficulty is derived from the learner's mastery, so a band that does not
actually change the work leaves a learner repeating the same problem at every level.

#### Scenario: Higher difficulty produces larger work

- **WHEN** a skill is sampled across its full difficulty range
- **THEN** problems at the highest difficulty are measurably larger than at the lowest

#### Scenario: A flat difficulty ladder is rejected

- **WHEN** a skill produces the same operand range at every difficulty
- **THEN** the check fails and names the skill

### Requirement: Degenerate problems never reach the learner

A generator SHALL reject operand choices that teach nothing — a quantity multiplied by zero,
a value subtracted from itself, an operand of 1 where the skill is about combining — and draw
again rather than contorting its selection logic to avoid them. It SHALL also produce varied
problems rather than repeating a small handful across a lesson.

#### Scenario: Trivial operands are redrawn

- **WHEN** a draw produces operands the skill considers degenerate
- **THEN** the draw is rejected and repeated

#### Scenario: Sampling shows variety

- **WHEN** a skill is sampled across its difficulty range
- **THEN** the sample contains many distinct problems rather than a few repeated ones

### Requirement: Every part of a problem agrees with every other part

A problem's display, hint, solution steps, and predicted misconceptions SHALL all describe
the same arithmetic on the same operands. A hint naming digits the display does not show, or
a solution step whose stated result contradicts the answer, is a defect even though every
individual piece is well-formed.

#### Scenario: Solution detail matches the displayed operands

- **WHEN** a solution step shows the arithmetic for a column
- **THEN** the digits it names are the digits of the operands actually displayed

#### Scenario: Predicted misconception follows the same working

- **WHEN** a misconception predicts the value a named mistake produces
- **THEN** that value is derived from the same operands the problem displays

### Requirement: Reworking how a generator is built does not change what it produces

When a generator is rewritten onto shared machinery without any intended change to its
content, its output SHALL remain identical for every seed and difficulty. The learner-facing
text of a working skill is authored content, and a refactor that quietly rewords a hint has
changed the course while claiming to change nothing.

#### Scenario: Refactor is checked against recorded output

- **WHEN** a generator is rebuilt on shared helpers with no intended content change
- **THEN** its sampled output matches the output recorded before the rebuild
- **AND** any difference fails the check and shows what changed

#### Scenario: Intended content changes are recorded deliberately

- **WHEN** a generator's content is deliberately changed
- **THEN** the recorded output is updated in the same change as a reviewable difference

### Requirement: A signed value is displayed and verified as one value

A problem MAY display a negative value, and MAY predict a mistake whose value is negative.
Where a sign is shown to the learner it SHALL use the same notation the rest of the course
uses for subtraction, and independent verification SHALL read a displayed sign as part of the
value it belongs to rather than as an operation applied to it.

One notation, in one place, is the requirement. The notation a learner reads and the notation
an answer is submitted in are allowed to differ — they already do — but a value that appears
twice in one view SHALL appear the same way both times. A display showing one sign glyph
beside an answer slot showing another is the control disagreeing with itself about what it
just did, which reads as a defect and cannot be distinguished from one.

#### Scenario: A signed display is recomputed correctly

- **WHEN** a problem displays arithmetic with one or more negative operands
- **THEN** verification evaluates it with each sign attached to its own value
- **AND** fails if the result differs from the answer the generator declared

#### Scenario: A predicted mistake may be negative

- **WHEN** a generator predicts a mistake whose value is below zero
- **THEN** the prediction is carried and diagnosed like any other
- **AND** it is filtered only if it equals the correct answer or another prediction

#### Scenario: One value does not appear in two notations at once

- **WHEN** a value the learner has entered is shown back beside a problem that also shows a sign
- **THEN** both are drawn with the same sign notation

### Requirement: The wording gate records every field a generator sets

The per-unit recorded-output gate SHALL render every field a problem carries, and SHALL fail
naming any field a generator sets that it does not render.

A field the gate does not render is a field the gate does not protect. What a problem permits
to be typed into it, and which line a value is placed on, are both authored decisions that
change what the learner sees and can be got wrong silently — so both are recorded alongside
the prompt, the display and the answer rather than left to a reviewer to notice missing.

#### Scenario: An answer-entry declaration is recorded

- **WHEN** a generator declares which character classes its answer may use
- **THEN** the recorded output for that problem shows the declaration

#### Scenario: A declared number line is recorded

- **WHEN** a generator declares the line its answer is placed on
- **THEN** the recorded output for that problem shows that line

#### Scenario: An unrendered field fails the gate

- **WHEN** a generator sets a field the gate does not render
- **THEN** the gate fails and names that field
